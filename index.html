<h1>3D SCULPTING</h1>
</div>
<p>3D sculpting is a digital art form that involves shaping and modeling virtual objects in a three-dimensional space, much like traditional clay sculpting. 
Using a software such as Blender, artists can manipulate digital "clay" with brushes and tools to create detailed characters, objects, and environments.</p>

<h2>Creating a 3D Still Life </h2>
<p>As part of the DGA1020 study unit, I have modelled a bowl of fruit using <em>Blender</em>. This was done by transforming simple shapes by rotating, 
   extruding, moving and scaling points in order to create the desired objects. Once everything was modelled, the bowl was placed on a turntable were the camera
   rotated around the setup so as to fully showcase the entire still life from every angle. Once the camera animation was complete, lighting was added to create 
   a better environment and to add a splash of colour to the overall composition.   </p>
