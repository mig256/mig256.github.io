 <h1>2D and 3D Design</h1>
</div>
  
<div> 
<p>2D Design, in this case involves designing pixel-based charactersand creating animated sprites. This style emphasizes simplicity and clarity, 
often working within small resolutions. The limited colour palette and precise placement of pixels defines the features, movement, and personality. 
Sprite sheets allow artists to bring characters to life frame by frame, making it a popular choice for game development and retro-style art projects.</p> 
</div>   
  
<p>3D sculpting is a digital art form that involves shaping and modeling virtual objects in a three-dimensional space, much like traditional clay sculpting. 
Using a software such as Blender, artists can manipulate digital "clay" with brushes and tools to create detailed characters, objects, and environments.</p>

<h2>Creating a 3D Still Life </h2>
<p>As part of the DGA1020 study unit, I have modelled a bowl of fruit using <em>Blender</em>. This was done by transforming simple shapes by rotating, 
   extruding, moving and scaling points in order to create the desired objects. Once everything was modelled, the bowl was placed on a turntable were the camera
   rotated around the setup so as to fully showcase the entire still life from every angle. Once the camera animation was complete, lighting was added to create 
   a better environment and to add a splash of colour to the overall composition.   </p>
