<h1>2D and 3D Design <em>by Miguel Enriquez</em></h1>
</div>
  
<div> 
<p>2D Design, in this case involves designing pixel-based charactersand creating animated sprites. This style emphasizes simplicity and clarity, 
often working within small resolutions. The limited colour palette and precise placement of pixels defines the features, movement, and personality. 
Sprite sheets allow artists to bring characters to life frame by frame, making it a popular choice for game development and retro-style art projects.</p> 
</div>   
  
<p>3D Sculpting, on the other hand is a digital art form that involves shaping and modeling virtual objects in a three-dimensional space, much like traditional 
clay sculpting. Using a software such as Blender, artists can manipulate digital "clay" with brushes and tools to create detailed characters, objects, and 
environments.</p>

<h2>Creating a 2D Pixel Character </h2>
</div> 
<p>As part of the DGA1020 study unit, I designed my own 2D pixel character. Using the app <em>Piskel,</em> I created a spritesheet of my character - a 
Skeleton Pirate. Then on <em>Unity,</em> I imported the entire spritesheet and animated the charcter to make him move and produce a number of different
movements such as him walking, running, jumping, falling and finally dying.</p>

<h2>Creating a 3D Still Life </h2>
</div> 
<p>Also part of the DGA1020 study unit, I have modelled a bowl of fruit using <em>Blender</em>. This was done by transforming simple shapes by rotating, 
   extruding, moving and scaling points in order to create the desired objects. Once everything was modelled, the bowl was placed on a turntable were the camera
   rotated around the setup so as to fully showcase the entire still life from every angle. Once the animation was complete, lighting was added to create 
   a better environment and to add a splash of colour to the overall composition.   </p>
